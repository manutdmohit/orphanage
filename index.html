      <h1>Welcome to VOLUNTEERS WITHOUT FRONTIERS</h1>
      <p>
        Where Tikapur, Kailali, Nepal. <br />
        Target <br />• from enclaves of landless people of Mukta Kamaiya (freed
        slaves) and Sukumbasi (literally landless, usually belonging to low
        castes) settled in the Tikapur's surroundings. <br/ > • from Dalit
        communities (ex-untouchable people), indigenous or minority groups.
        <br />
        • orphans or neglected children. <br />
        <br/ > Tikapur Children Home <br />
        <br />Currently the TCH hosts 26 children from the above mentioned
        target communities. The children are offered food, shelter, clothing and
        medical care throughout the year. Beneficiaries attend private school in
        Tikapur, where lessons are conducted in English. We furthermore provide
        side activities such as study and homework support (English and
        mathematics classes by local or international volunteers), sports and
        recreation activities. School Scholarship In Nepal, education represents
        both a direct and an indirect cost for families: on one hand the direct
        costs of fees, uniform, books and teaching materials, and on the other
        hand, the lack of further active workers at home when sending children
        at school. Since school fees and teaching materials are becoming more
        and more expensive every year, the misery economic conditions usually
        discourage families from giving a further scholar education to their
        children. Every year, many students drop out. The reasons can be
        different, but they are generally connected to a single specific cause:
        poverty. Many young students, within the first two scholar years migrate
        to India for seasonal works, and in many cases, they do not come back or
        decide not to continue their studies. We also provide assistance for the
        troubles caused by change of scholarship assignment program which
        depends on the academic level and on the family economic condition of
        the beneficiaries: we pay for their tuition fees and we provide them
        with uniforms, books, teaching materials and school bags. School Support
        Scheme Every year we support 4 schools in the rural areas of Bijaynagar,
        Shivanagar, Shaktinagar, Ektanagar. Even if schools are legally
        registered, they usually do not receive funds by the government.
        Moreover, schools, often under budget deficit, are thus forced to
        increase their fees, and such condition directly affects the students'
        families. As education prices keep increasing, the poor families living
        in poverty in the landless rural communities cannot afford to enroll
        children at school. With our support we can indirectly reduce the direct
        costs on families, and incentive children schooling. The indirect
        beneficiaries of this program are approximately 800 children. The
        support includes contributions: *for a salary of a teacher in each
        school; *random needs depending on school (furniture, books, school
        materials, materials for the construction of buildings). Health Project
        In Nepal, the health service is not free. Poor health conditions are
        often the cause of school dropout and of families getting into debts.
        With our health project we provide for regular medical examinations in 4
        villages for children who attend elementary school. For beneficiaries of
        the scholarships that come from other communities outside those
        mentioned, we organize camps at the VWF building in Tikapur. We have
        also allocated funds for specific treatments that require more intensive
        monitoring and ongoing expenses that families would not be able to
        support. For the organization of this project we cooperate with
        qualified doctors, Nepalese health workers and volunteers of the
        beneficiary communities. Total beneficiaries amount: about 800 children
        Water Access to water is still one of the most important issues within
        the beneficiary communities. In the village of Ektanagar, for example,
        there is a pump approximately every 25 families. In recent years we have
        tried to provide the community with water pumps for domestic use. Before
        the installation of the pumps, the groundwater analysis for the
        detection of arsenic is carried out (for the moment, no traces were
        found). Beneficiaries: Around 1200 households.
